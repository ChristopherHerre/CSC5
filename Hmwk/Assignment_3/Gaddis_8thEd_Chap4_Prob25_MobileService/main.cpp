 * 25. Mobile Service Provider
 * A mobile phone service provider has three different subscription packages
 * for its customers:
 * 
 * Package A: For $39.99 per month 450 minutes are provided. Additional minutes
 * are $0.45 per minute.
 * 
 * Package B: For $59.99 per month 900 minutes are provided. Additional minutes
 * are $0.40 per minute.
 * 
 * Package C: For $69.99 per month unlimited minutes provided.
 * 
 * Write a program that calculates a customerâ€™s monthly bill. It should ask
 * which package the customer has purchased and how many minutes were used.
 * It should then display the total amount due.
 * 
 * Input Validation: Be sure the user only selects package A, B, or C.
