 * 8. Total Purchase
 * A customer in a store is purchasing five items. The prices of the five items
 * are:

 * $15.95
 * $24.95
 * $6.95
 * $12.95
 * $3.95
 * 
 * Write a program that holds the prices of the five items in five variables.
 * Display each itemâ€™s price, the subtotal of the sale, the amount of sales tax,
 * and the total. Assume the sales tax is 7%.
