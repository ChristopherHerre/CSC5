 * 9. Cyborg Data Type Sizes
 * You have been given a job as a programmer on a Cyborg supercomputer. In
 * order to accomplish some calculations, you need to know how many bytes the
 * following data types use: char , int , float , and double . You do not have
 * any manuals, so you canâ€™t look this information up. Write a C++ program
 * that will determine the amount of memory used by these types and display
 * the information on the screen.
